## üîí Note on Anonymization

All examples in this directory have been **anonymized** to protect proprietary business logic:
- Specific feature names generalized (e.g., "content generation" vs specific types)
- Migration timestamps removed
- Service provider names genericized where appropriate
- Internal file paths kept generic

The **security patterns and findings remain accurate** and representative of real-world audits.
